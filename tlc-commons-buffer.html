<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The commons buffer classes provide a set of utilities for easily getting and setting
data inside of a buffer, usually of a fixed length. These are typically records received 
in files from mainframe type systems that are not XML, JSON, or comma-delimited. Each
record contains data in fixed positions (columns) in the record. </p>

<h2>ByteBuffer</h2>
<p>The central class provided here is the ByteBuffer. This class provides read and 
	write methods for a number of different kinds of data type to be placed at
	fixed displacements and lengths in the buffer.</p>
	<p> Because data received from
	IBM systems is often EBCDIC instead of ASCII, each buffer is associated with
	an encoding scheme so that read and writes will get and store the data in the
	proper scheme. Strings that are written to the buffer that are in UNICODE are
	converted to the appropriate single-byte ASCII or EBCDIC code. Strings that are
	read from the buffer will be converted into UNICODE appropriately based on the 
	buffer encoding.</p>
	<p>Integer and longs that are stored in binary can be different endian formats.
		Each buffer is with an endian type for storing this binary data in a particular endian
		format. When these numbers are written to the buffer, the proper endian 
		structure is maintained. Similarly for reading numbers from the buffer.</p>
	<p>See the Javadoc for all the different read and write methods 
	available.</p>

	<p>These include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>String (character) data</li>
		<li>Integer, Long, Short, and Byte</li>
		<li>Packed decimal -- signed and unsigned</li>
	</ul>
