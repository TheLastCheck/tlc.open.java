{"name":"tlc.open.java","tagline":"TLC APIs for reading and writing general purpose buffers and for processing X9.37 files","body":"This is a project providing a Java implementation of various TLC API\r\nfor managing byte arrays and X937 files.\r\n\r\n**tlc-commons-buffer** -- a set of utility classes for managing getting and setting data fields in a fixed length buffer. This is used mostly in dealing with mainframe records and supports reading and writing data from the buffer in both ASCII and EBCDIC.\r\n\r\n**tlc-commons-base** -- a set of utility classes used by other components of the API. Also includes a general purpose directory scanner, an username/password encrypter, and a JavaFX dialog to read and write them.\r\n\r\n**tlc-io-base** -- a set of classes common to all the TLC io classes.\r\n\r\n**tlc-io-x937** -- a set of classes for reading, writing, and parsing X9.37 format files.\r\n\r\nAll jars are available through [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.thelastcheck.commons%22).\r\n\r\n Copyright [2009-2015] [The Last Check, LLC]\r\n\r\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n   limitations under the License.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
